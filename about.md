Thank you for visiting my site. I am a teacher, a writer, and a dad. I enjoy learning software and writing about my experience. I also love baseball, cooking, and reading old books. 

For examples of my work visit my [projects](https://johnnycase.github.io/projects/) page, and my work history can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnecase/).

If you would like to connect for an upcoming project or just to chat, please email me or message me on twitter.
